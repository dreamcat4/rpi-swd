=====

This is programmer for the STM32F051 microcontroller which is designed to run
on the Raspberry Pi. It uses the Serial Wire Debug protocol which is a two-wire
connection which is mostly compatible to JTAG.

Currently the code only implements programming the firmware into flash, other
operations might be implemented in the future. As the protocol is bit-banged
and does not have any reliable form of error detection, the quality of the
result generally will vary.

The code has been shamelessly copied^H^Hinspired from the pirate-swd project
which implements the protocol for the Bus Pirate.
